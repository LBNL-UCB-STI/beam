BEAM stands for Behavior, Energy, Autonomy, and Mobility. The model is being developed as a framework for a series of research studies in sustainable transportation at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the UC Berkeley Institute for Transportation Studies.  

BEAM extend the [Multi-Agent Transportation Simulation Framework](https://github.com/matsim-org/matsim) (MATSim) to enable powerful and scalable analysis of urban transportation systems.
