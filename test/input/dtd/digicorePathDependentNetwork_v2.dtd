<!-- A concise format to write the path-dependent complex network
	 created from parsing Digicore vehicle activity chains. In 
	 this second version we allow for nodes that act as first 
	 'major' activities to have local knowledge about the start
	 hour as well as the number of minor activities in the chain
	 originating from that node.       							  -->
