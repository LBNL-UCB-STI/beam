 Documentation:


 "smartdata_setup.py": contains the script for downloading events file, summaryStat and beamLog that is going to be stored locally.
 Once downloaded the script will extract from files the required data that going to formatted and aggregated then stored in a csv file named as: {year}.{iteration}.metrics-final.csv
 The script also generates the sankey-diagram, under the "sankey" folder

 "smartdata_run.py": In this file you would want to define the scenarios and their correspondent S3 folders (this script assume that all scenarios have the same link, but with different folders) as follows:
 (Rank, Year, Iteration, Scenario, Technology, Scenario-Technology folder name in the S3 link, Run folder corresponding to the Year and Scenario)
Rank here, serves as a way to order matrices or vectors in certain way to be able to do matrix and vector multiplication.

 ****

 "smartplots_setup.py": contains the scripts generating the different plots.
 To add a new plot, one will need to create a function that does that specific plot, then call it from "smartplots_run.py"

"smartplots_run.py": contains the configuration required to generate a plot for a certain scenario.
this is the main script that should be run to generate plots.
Optionally, it is possible to call this script from "smartdata_run.py" immediately after the files have been downloaded, stored and processed.


**** NEW

"smartplots2_setup.py": contains same plot as "smartplots_setup.py", but these plots have mixed years

"smartplots2_run.py": steps for plotting different scenarios in different years
name => is the prefix for every png/csv file
scenarios_id => the ids of the scenarios to plotted in that order
scenarios_itr => the iteration from which to extract the corresponding data
scenarios_year => the year from which to extract the corresponding data
bottom_labels => labels at the bottom of x axis (scenarios)
top_labels => labels on top fo the x axis (technologies)
