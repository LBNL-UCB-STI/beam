* R5 and GH routes are different. Distances: 2255 vs 2880.
* Only `waypoints` layers are visible out of box.
* R5 waypoints reside right in the middle of every lane in the route.
* GH waypoints reside in vertices. Start/end are on lanes, perfectly close to the OD.
* GH route respects the position of origin and contains turnarounds.
