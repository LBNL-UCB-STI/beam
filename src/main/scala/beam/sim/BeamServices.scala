/**
  * MATSim heavily uses Guice-based dependency injection (DI),
  * and BEAM somewhat uses it, too.
  *
  * This class is a device used by BEAM classes that can't passively use DI,
  * but still need to access things that are only available via the Injector.
  *
  * If there are any vars here, we're still in the process of refactoring them away.
  * Please don't add any.
  *
  * Actually, you probably don't need to add anything:
  *
  * If you want to introduce a new simulation-wide data container and you're wondering
  * where to put it, look no further than [[BeamScenario]].
  *
  * If you want to introduce a new simulated entity (which is, of course, restarted every
  * iteration), you want to write a [[beam.agentsim.agents.BeamAgent]] and
  * start it from [[BeamMobsimIteration]] (or from another [[beam.agentsim.agents.BeamAgent]]).
  *
  * If you want to introduce a new thing that keeps track of something iteration-to-iteration,
  * like the [[beam.agentsim.agents.ridehail.RideHailIterationHistory]],
  * please bind it into the [[Injector]] (see that class for how this is done), and let it listen
  * to events. If you want simulated entities to access that thing to look something up,
  * pass it through [[BeamMobsim]] into [[BeamMobsimIteration]], and further into your simulated entity,
  * but take care to not violate the actor model, i.e. the simulated entity must only look at a part of your class
  * that is immutable during the iteration (e.g. put together after each iteration). If that is not
  * possible, maybe the thing you want to write is really a simulated entity, in which case see above.
  *
  * For now, use MATSim constructs like [[org.matsim.core.events.handler.EventHandler]] and
  * [[org.matsim.core.controler.listener.ControlerListener]] to let your thing observe the simulation.
  *
  * Note that the bit about the [[Injector]] is totally tangential, it's just the currently most
  * consistent place to put this kind of thing. Nothing keeps us from getting rid of that construct, if
  * so desired, but we would need our own replacement for [[Controler]], and refactor [[BeamSim]] and
  * [[BeamMobsim]]. Please don't create a global variable because you don't like the [[Injector]].
  *
  * IMPORTANT: The code below is not typical code. It is the most atypical code. It is the implementation
  * of a refactoring device. Real code never needs to directly reference the injector in any way, except
  * in the outermost layer, the main method basically. [[BeamHelper]] in our case.
  * If you see a reference to an injector in user code, please try to remove it.
  *
