   * allocates single-occupant rides. For pooled rides, you will need to use the "Pooling" allocation manager
   * or a variation on that manager.
   *
   * This method is designed to be called multiple times for every batch of allocations. Take a single request
   * as a simple example. If AllocationRequests contains only one request, the process flow will look like this:
   *
   * --- allocateVehiclesToCustomers is called with an AllocationRequest that contains request info but no route
   * --- the response to the above call is a VehicleAllocations object containing a RoutingRequiredToAllocateVehicle
   * --- the Ride Hail Manager will calculate the route and then call this method again, now with a request AND a route
   * --- based on the request and routing info, a final allocation will be created in the form of a VehicleMatchedToCustomers object
   * --- exceptions to the above is if an allocation can't be made in which case a NoVehicleAllocated response is returned
   *
   * The above process flow is identical for a batch of multiple requests, except that now the AllocationRequests and the VehicleAllocations
   * objects contain multiple requests and responses.
